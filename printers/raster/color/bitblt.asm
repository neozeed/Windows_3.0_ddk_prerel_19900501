;	The DEV structure contains all the information taken from the
;	PDevices passed in.  PDevices are copied to the frame to reduce
;	the number of long pointer loads required.  Having the data
;	contained in the structure allows MOVSW to be used when copying
;	the data.
;
;	WidthBits	The number of pixels wide the device is.
;
;	Height		The number of scans high the device is.
;
;	WidthB		The width of a scan in bytes.
;
;	lpBits		The pointer to the actual bits of the device.
;			It will be adjusted as necessary to point to the
;			first byte to be modified by the BLT operation.
;
;	PlaneW		Width of one plane of data.  Only used if the
;			device is a small color bitmap.

;			SpansSeg   - BLT will span 64K segment of the device
;			ColorUp    - Generate color scan line update
;			IsColor    - Device is a color device
;
;	CompTest	JC or JNC opcode, used in the huge bitmap scan line
;			update code.  This opcode is based on whether the
;			BLT is Y+, or Y-.
;
;	CompValue	Range of addresses to compare the offset against
;			to determine if overflow occured.  CompTest is the

;		be zeroed, and the lastMask set to all 0's (don't alter any
;		bits in last byte which will be the byte following the first
;		(and only) byte).

;	The conversion is mono to color.  Generate the code to
;	do the conversion, and generate the table which will
;	have the conversion values in it.
;
;	When going from mono to color, 1 bits are considered to be
;	the background color, and 0 bits are considered to be the
;	foreground color.
;
;	For each plane:
;
;	  If the foreground=background=1, then 1 can be used in
;	  place of the source.
;
;	  If the foreground=background=0, then 0 can be used in
;	  place of the source.
;
;	  If the foreground=0 and background=1, then the source
;	  can be used as is.
;
;	  If the foreground=1 and background=0, then the source
;	  must be complemented before using.
;
;	  Looks like a boolean function to me.
;
;	An AND mask and an XOR mask will be computed for each plane,
;	based on the above.  The source will then be processed against
;	the table.  The generated code should look like
;
;		lodsb
;		and	al,ss:[xxxx]
;		xor	al,ss:[xxxx+1]
;
;
;	The table for munging the colors as stated above should look like:
;
;	     BackGnd   ForeGnd	  Result    AND  XOR
;		1	  1	    1	     00   FF
;		0	  0	    0	     00   00
;		1	  0	    S	     FF   00
;		0	  1	not S	     FF   FF
;
;	From this, it can be seen that the XOR mask is the same as the
;	foreground color.  The AND mask is the XOR of the foreground
;	and the background color.  Not too hard to compute
;
;
;	It can also be seen that if the background color is white and the
;	foreground (text) color is black, then the conversion needn't be
;	generated (it just gives the source).  This is advantagous since
;	it will allow phased aligned source copies to use REP MOVSW.

;	We have something for a loop count.  If this just happens to be
;	a source copy (S) with a phase of zero, then the innerloop degenerates
;	to a repeated MOVSB instruction.  This little special case is
;	worth checking for and handling!
;
;	Also, if this is one of the special cases {P, Pn, DDx, DDxn}, then it
;	will also be special cased since these are all pattern fills (pattern,
;	not pattern, 0, 1).
;
;	The same code can be shared for these routines, with the exception
;	that patterns use a STOSx instruction instead of a MOVSx instruction
;	and need a value loaded in AX
;
;
;	So we lied a little.  If a color conversion is going on, then the
;	REP MOVSB might not be usable.	If the RepOK flag has been set, then
;	we can use it.	The RepOK flag will be set for a mono ==> color
;	conversion where the background color is white and the foreground
;	color is black, or for a color ==> mono conversion with the screen
;	as the source (the color compare register will be used).
;
;	For the special cases {P, Pn, DDx, DDxn}, color conversion is
;	not possible, so ignore it for them.

;	Looping logic.
;
;	The looping logic must handle monochrome bitmaps, color bitmaps,
;	huge bitmaps, the device, the presence or absence of a source
;	or pattern, and mono <==> color interactions.
;
;	The type of looping logic is always based on the destination.
;
;
;	Plane Update Facts:
;
;	1)  If the destination device is color, then there will be
;	    logic for plane selection.	Plane selection is performed
;	    at the start of the loop for the display.  Plane selection
;	    for bitmaps is performed at the end of the loop in anticipation
;	    of the next plane.
;
;
;	    The following applies when the destination is color:
;
;
;	    a)	The destination update consists of:
;
;		1)  If the destination is the display, the next plane will
;		    be selected by the plane selection code at the start
;		    of the scan line loop.
;
;		2)  If not the display, then the PDevice must a bitmap.
;		    The next plane will be selected by updating the
;		    destination offset by the PlaneW value.
;
;
;	    b)	If GagChoke isn't specified, then there may be a source.
;		If there is a source, it must be color, and the update
;		consists of:
;
;		1)  If the source is the display, the next plane will be
;		    selected by the plane selection code at the start of
;		    the loop.
;
;		2)  If not the display, then the PDevice must a bitmap.
;		    The next plane will be selected by updating the
;		    destination offset by the PlaneW value.
;
;
;	    c)	If GagChoke is specified, then the source must be a
;		monochrome bitmap which is undergoing mono to color
;		conversion.  The AND & XOR mask table which is used
;		for the conversion will have to be updated, unless
;		the NoMunge flag is set indicating that the color
;		conversion really wasn't needed.
;
;		The source's pointer will not be updated.  It will
;		remain pointing to the same scan of the source until
;		all planes of the destination have been processed.
;
;
;	    d)	In all cases, the plane mask rotation code will be
;		generated.  If the plane indicator doesn't overflow,
;		then start at the top of the scan line loop for the
;		next plane.
;
;		If the plane indicator overflows, then:
;
;		    1)	If there is a pattern present, it's a color
;			pattern fetch.	The index of which scan of
;			the brush to use will have to be updated.
;
;		    2)	Enter the scan line update routine
;
;
;	2)	If the destination is monochrome, then there will be no
;		plane selection logic.
;
;		If GagChoke is specified, then color ==> mono conversion
;		is taking place.  Any plane selection logic is internal
;		to the ROP byte fetch code.  Any color brush was pre-
;		processed into a monochrome brush, so no brush updating
;		need be done

subttl	Scan Line Update Generation
page


;	YUpdate - Generate Y Update Code
;
;	The Y update code is generated as follows:
;
;	For the display, small bitmaps, and huge bitmaps where the BLT
;	doesn't span a segment bounday, all that need be done is add
;	NextScan to the offset portion of the bits pointer.  NextScan
;	is a 2's complement if the BLT is Y-, so an addition can always
;	be done.
;
;	    < add   si,NextScan >
;	      add   di,NextScan
;
;
;	For huge bitmaps where the BLT spans a segment boundary, the
;	above update must be performed, and the overflow/undeflow
;	detected.  This isn't too hard to detect.
;
;	For any huge bitmap, there can be a maximum of Planes*bmWidthBytes-1
;	unused bytes in a 64K segment.	The minimum is 0.  The scan line
;	update always updates to the first plane of the next (previous) scan.
;
;
;	When the BLT is Y+, if the new offset is anywhere within the
;	unused bytes of a segment, or in the first scan of a segment,
;	then overflow must have occured:
;
;	      -bmFillBytes <= offset < Planes*bmWidthBytes
;
;	Since the update is always made to the first plane of a scan,
;	Planes in the above equation can be thrown out.  Also, if
;	bmFillBytes is added to both sides of the equation:
;
;		0 <= offset < bmWidthBytes+bmFillBytes	(unsigned compare)
;
;	will be true if overflow occurs.  The Y+ overflow check will
;	look like:
;
;
;	    lea ax,bmFillBytes[si]		;Adjust for fill bytes now
;	    cmp ax,bmWidthBytes+bmFillBytes	;Overflow occur?
;	    jnc NoOverflow			;  No
;	    cmp cx,2				;Any more scans?
;	    jnc NoOverflow			;  No, don't update selector
;	    add si,bmFillBytes			;Step over fill bytes
;	    mov ax,ds				;Compute new selector
;	    add ax,bmSegmentIndex
;	    mov ds,ax
;
;	  NoOverflow:
;
;
;
;	For Y- BLTs, the test is almost the same.  The equation becomes
;
;	   -(Planes*bmWidthBytes) > offset	(unsigned compare)
;
;	then underflow occurs.	Planes in the above equation cannot be
;	thrown out.  The Y- underflow check will look like:
;
;	    mov ax,si
;	    cmp ax,-(Planes*bmWidthBytes)	;Overflow occur?
;	    jc	NoOverflow			;  No
;	    cmp cx,2				;Any more scans?
;	    jnc NoOverflow			;  No, don't update selector
;	    add si,bmFillBytes			;Step over fill bytes
;	    mov ax,ds				;Compute new selector
;	    add ax,bmSegmentIndex
