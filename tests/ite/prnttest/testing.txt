Defined Testing Structures


ENUMERATE
Device Enumeration Structure

The ENUMERATE structure contains the device context, count, and array of
device objects which can be enumerated by the Windows functions.  This is
useful for tests which focus on combinations of Pens, Brushes and Fonts.

typedef struct tagENUMERATE
     {
          HDC          hDC;
          GLOBALHANDLE hGMem;
          short        nCount;
     } ENUMERATE;

hDC     The device context in which the objects were obtained.
hGMem   A handle to a global array which contains the structures for those
        objects gathered from the enumeration routines.
nCount  The count of objects returned from the enumeration routine.



DEVCAPABILITIES
Device capabilities structure

The DEVCAPABILITIES structure contains the information returned from calling
the GetDevCaps() routine.


typedef struct
     {
          short nDriverVersion;
          short nTechnology;
          short nHorzSizeMM;
          short nVertSizeMM;
          short nHorzRes;
          short nVertRes;
          short nLogPixelsX;
          short nLogPixelsY;
          short nBitsPixel;
          short nPlanes;
          short nBrushes;
          short nPens;
          short nFonts;
          short nColors;
          short nAspectX;
          short nAspectY;
          short nAspectXY;
          short nPDeviceSize;
          WORD  wClipCaps;
          WORD  wRasterCaps;
          WORD  wCurveCaps;
          WORD  wLineCaps;
          WORD  wPolygonCaps;
          WORD  wTextCaps;
     } DEVCAPABILITIES;
