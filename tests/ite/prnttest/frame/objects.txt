PRINTER DRIVER OBJECTS (Pens and Brushes)

The following pages contain the Pens and Brushes this particular printer driver supports.  They are obtained by calling the device EnumObj() function.	If the device does not perform it's own enumeration, then it is passed on to GDI to provide the
brushes Display  Drivers enumeration routine.  This has an adverse effect for the
printer driver.  Since the Display Driver is supplying the objects, it will
generate all objects which it supports.  If it is a color driver, then it will
produce objects for all colors that it supports.  Most printer drivers support
only two colors (BLACK, WHITE).

If this printer driver doesn't perform it's own enumeration, then some of the
output might look odd.  Particularly outputing WHITE/HATCHED brushes.  They
could tend to look like a SOLID WHITE BRUSH, depending whether the printer
driver supports the output of WHITE/HATCHED brushes.

Pens are usually enumerated by printer drivers.
