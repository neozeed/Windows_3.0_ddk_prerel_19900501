RASTER TEST (StretchBlt Test)

TEST
     This tests the outputing of bitmaps to the printer driver.  It should only
     be run if the device is capable of supportinng raster output.  The bitamp
     is stored as an application resource.  It is loaded by GDI, then output
     to the printer in the form of a STRETCHBLT() call.  The resource bitmap is
     stored as a 72x72 pixel image.  This is very small in printer device
     coordinates, so it is stretched to show a more reasonable depiction.

     If the driver has the capability to stretch the image, then it will do
     all the work.  Otherwise, GDI performs the strecthing in memory before it
     is output to the printer.  Check the Device Capabilities Header to
     determine if the StretchBlt() function is supported.

     The test will perform the following on the bitmap:
          a) Stretch image in device discrete increments.
          b) Stretch image vertically.
          c) Stretch image horizontally.
          d) Stretch image in non discrete increments.

ASSUMPTIONS
     No assumptions.

EXPECTED RESULTS
     You should expect to see 4 bitmaps, each one showing a different stretch
     facter.
